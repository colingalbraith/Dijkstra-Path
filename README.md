Graph Pathfinding Visualizer
Description
This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) app developed using Pygame to visualize Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. Users can interactively create nodes, connect them with edges, and visualize the pathfinding process.

Features
Node Placement: Click to place nodes.
Node Connection: Right-click to create edges between nodes.
Pathfinding: Double-click on two nodes to visualize the shortest path.
Node Deletion: Press space and click to delete a node.
Graph Reset: Middle click to reset the graph.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or above
Pygame
Numpy
Setup
Clone the repository and install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dijkstra-Path.git
cd Dijkstra-Path
pip install pygame numpy
Usage
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python pathfinding_visualizer.py
Controls
Left Click: Place a node.
Right Click: Connect two nodes.
Middle Click: Reset the graph.
Space + Left Click: Delete a node.
Double Left Click: Select two nodes to visualize the shortest path.
