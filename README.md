# Graph Pathfinding Visualizer

## Description
This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) app developed using Pygame to visualize Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. Users can interactively create nodes, connect them with edges, and visualize the pathfinding process.

## Features
- **Node Placement**: Click to place nodes.
- **Node Connection**: Right-click to create edges between nodes.
- **Pathfinding**: Double-click on two nodes to visualize the shortest path.
- **Node Deletion**: Press space and click to delete a node.
- **Graph Reset**: Middle click to reset the graph.

## Installation

- Pygame
- Numpy

### Setup
Clone the repository and install the required packages:
